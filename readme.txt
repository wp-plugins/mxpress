The mxPress Plugin creates a Mxit comptaible version of your WordPress site. Allowing you to host a Mxit App via WordPress with no development required.

== Description ==

- What is Mxit? - 

Mxit started in 2006 as a chat client for feature phones which allowed users to send messages to each other at low cost (using the data available on phones, rather than SMS)
Since then, Mxit has grown to become the largest social network in South Africa, with 9.3 million active users measured in a 12 week period up to the end of June 2012.
Users on Mxit now not only send direct messages to each other, but also use Mxit to access services which include chat rooms, games like chess, and use 3rd party Mxit services. This includes Kazazoom services such as Ask.Kim.


= What does this plugin do? =

In a nutshell, the mxPress WordPress Plugin allows anyone (even non-developers) who are currently running a Blog, Website, or Mobi Site using WordPress, to automatically show their WordPress site on Mxit as a contact.
Mxit users can now invite “yourname.blog” on Mxit, and will then see your Blog on  their phone.
As an example, invite “wpmx” on Mxit and see THIS SITE on Mxit. It is being displayed on Mxit by the mxPress plugin. All we did was install the plugin into this WordPress site that you are reading right now.
Why would I use this plugin?

Typically, to create a Mxit App you would need to code an App from scratch using the Mxit C# API or Mxit Mobi API. With this plugin, you do not need to do any development to get your existing (or new) WordPress site integrated with Mxit.
Mxit has opened up their platform to 3rd party developers which means anybody, yes even you can host a Mxit App on the Mxit Platform, read more at the Mxit Developer Site.
